"Without data, you're just another person with an opinion." â€” W. Edwards Deming

ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Swaifa!

Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the world of Big Data with a Masterâ€™s in Professional Computer Science at Simon Fraser University. 

Hereâ€™s a quick backstory on how I got here:

My passion for programming ignited in 11th grade when I first encountered C++ and object-oriented programming. This initial exposure was just the beginning of my tech journey, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from VIT Chennai, where I specialized in AI and ML. 

I knew computing was interesting, but what fascinated me even more was how AI and ML were the backbones of anything and everything in tech. 

I was captivated by the transformative power of AI and its integration with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, IoT, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Operating Systems. This multidisciplinary approach provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how technology shapes and enhances the world.

During my undergraduate, I had the opportunity to work with various companies, managing teams and gaining insights into the operational aspects of businesses. These experiences were invaluable, providing me with a practical understanding of how businesses work and what goes into building/managing one.

The idea of using all this knowledge to change the world was both surreal and exciting, but I knew I wasnâ€™t there yet and that there was still so much more to learn.

I had explored all sub-domains in tech except Big data. It was the one area I hadnâ€™t yet explored, and that mystery only made me more excited to dive in.

Before I knew it, I found myself studying Big Data at SFU.

Today, I feel closer than ever to diving deep into specific technologies like Hadoop and Hive, mastering them, and using them to build and manage tech both ethically and at scale. While many people worry that AI might lead to job losses, Iâ€™m focused on leveraging AI to enhance human creativity and create a better future.

I believe I can make the most impact by blending my technical expertise with operational skills to collaborate with product and business teams, driving the launch of groundbreaking technologies.
