ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Swaifa!

Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the world of Big Data with a Masterâ€™s in Professional Computer Science @ SFU, Canada. 

Hereâ€™s a quick backstory on how I got here:

My passion for programming ignited in 11th grade when I first encountered C++ and object-oriented programming. 

This initial exposure was just the beginning of my tech journey, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from VIT Chennai, where I specialized in AI and ML. 

During my undergraduate, I had the opportunity to work with various companies, managing teams and gaining insights into the operational aspects of businesses. 

These experiences were invaluable, providing me with a practical understanding of how businesses work and what goes into building/managing one. 

The idea of using all this knowledge to change the world was both surreal and exciting, but I knew I wasnâ€™t there yet and that there was still so much more to learn.

Today, I feel closer than ever to diving deep into specific technologies like Hadoop and Hive, mastering them, and using them to build and manage tech both ethically and at scale. 

While many people worry that AI might lead to job losses, Iâ€™m focused on leveraging AI to enhance human creativity and create a better future.

I believe I can make the most impact by blending my technical expertise with operational skills to collaborate with product and business teams, driving the launch of groundbreaking technologies.
